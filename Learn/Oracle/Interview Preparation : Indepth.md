# Oracle DBA Senior Interview Questions - Part 1 (Questions 1-25)

## Section A: Architecture & Memory Management (Questions 1-6)

### Question 1: SGA Memory Allocation Crisis
**Scenario:** Your 19c production database is experiencing ORA-00845 errors during peak hours. The database has 64GB RAM, SGA_TARGET=32GB, but you're seeing "cannot allocate memory" errors. Users report intermittent connection failures.

**Answer:** This is a classic /dev/shm (tmpfs) sizing issue in Linux. The ORA-00845 error occurs when Oracle tries to allocate more memory than available in the temporary filesystem used for SGA.

**Immediate Actions:**
- Check current /dev/shm usage: `df -h /dev/shm`
- Verify SGA allocation: `SELECT * FROM V$SGAINFO;`
- Check if AMM is enabled: `SHOW PARAMETER MEMORY_TARGET`

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Linux /dev/shm is typically 50% of physical RAM (32GB in this case)
- With SGA_TARGET=32GB, Oracle needs additional space for PGA and other allocations
- AMM (Automatic Memory Management) can dynamically grow beyond SGA_TARGET

**Resolution:**
1. Increase /dev/shm size: `mount -o remount,size=40G /dev/shm`
2. Make permanent in /etc/fstab: `tmpfs /dev/shm tmpfs defaults,size=40G 0 0`
3. Consider switching to ASMM: Set MEMORY_TARGET=0, tune SGA_TARGET and PGA_AGGREGATE_TARGET separately
4. Monitor with: `SELECT * FROM V$MEMORY_DYNAMIC_COMPONENTS;`

### Question 2: RAC Cache Fusion Performance Issue
**Scenario:** In your 4-node RAC cluster, you notice that queries running on Node 2 are 300% slower than identical queries on Node 1. AWR shows high 'gc buffer busy acquire' and 'gc current request' wait events.

**Answer:** This indicates cache fusion inefficiency and potential interconnect issues in RAC.

**Diagnostic Steps:**
```sql
-- Check interconnect latency
SELECT * FROM V$CLUSTER_INTERCONNECTS;

-- Analyze cache fusion statistics
SELECT * FROM GV$CR_BLOCK_SERVER ORDER BY INST_ID;

-- Check for hot blocks
SELECT * FROM GV$BH WHERE DIRTY = 'Y' AND INST_ID = 2;
```

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Cache fusion requires blocks to be transferred between nodes
- High 'gc buffer busy acquire' suggests Node 2 is waiting for blocks from other nodes
- Possible causes: Network latency, hot blocks, uneven data distribution

**Resolution Strategy:**
1. **Interconnect Optimization:**
   - Verify dedicated interconnect bandwidth
   - Check for packet loss: `netstat -i`
   - Tune network parameters: `net.core.rmem_max`, `net.core.wmem_max`

2. **Application-Level Fixes:**
   - Implement connection pooling with node affinity
   - Use services to direct specific workloads to specific nodes
   - Consider partitioning hot tables

3. **Database Tuning:**
   - Adjust `_gc_policy_time` parameter
   - Implement result cache for frequently accessed data
   - Monitor with: `SELECT * FROM GV$POLICY_HISTORY;`

### Question 3: Data Guard Lag Emergency
**Scenario:** Your physical standby database is lagging 4 hours behind primary during a critical business day. The alert log shows "ORA-00313: open failed for members of log group" and "ORA-00312: online log cannot be read". Recovery is stuck at a specific SCN.

**Answer:** This is a critical Data Guard synchronization failure, likely due to archive log corruption or network issues.

**Immediate Assessment:**
```sql
-- Check Data Guard status
SELECT PROCESS, STATUS, THREAD#, SEQUENCE#, BLOCK#, BLOCKS FROM V$MANAGED_STANDBY;

-- Verify archive log gap
SELECT THREAD#, LOW_SEQUENCE#, HIGH_SEQUENCE# FROM V$ARCHIVE_GAP;

-- Check apply lag
SELECT NAME, VALUE, DATUM_TIME FROM V$DATAGUARD_STATS WHERE NAME IN ('apply lag', 'transport lag');
```

**Emergency Recovery Steps:**
1. **Identify Missing Archives:**
   ```sql
   -- On primary
   SELECT THREAD#, MAX(SEQUENCE#) FROM V$ARCHIVED_LOG GROUP BY THREAD#;
   
   -- On standby
   SELECT THREAD#, MAX(SEQUENCE#) FROM V$ARCHIVED_LOG WHERE APPLIED = 'YES' GROUP BY THREAD#;
   ```

2. **Manual Archive Transfer:**
   - Copy missing archive logs from primary to standby
   - Register manually: `ALTER DATABASE REGISTER LOGFILE '/path/to/archive';`

3. **Incremental Backup Recovery (if corruption exists):**
   ```sql
   -- On primary
   BACKUP INCREMENTAL FROM SCN <stuck_scn> DATABASE FORMAT '/backup/incr_%U';
   
   -- On standby
   CATALOG START WITH '/backup/incr_';
   RECOVER DATABASE NOREDO;
   ```

4. **Restart Apply Process:**
   ```sql
   ALTER DATABASE RECOVER MANAGED STANDBY DATABASE CANCEL;
   ALTER DATABASE RECOVER MANAGED STANDBY DATABASE USING CURRENT LOGFILE DISCONNECT;
   ```

### Question 4: Background Process Failure Analysis
**Scenario:** Your database becomes unresponsive, and you find that SMON has died with ORA-00600 errors. The alert log shows "SMON: terminating instance due to error 600". How do you handle this critical situation?

**Answer:** SMON failure is critical as it handles system monitoring and recovery. This requires immediate intervention.

**Emergency Response:**
1. **Immediate Assessment:**
   ```bash
   # Check if instance is still accessible
   sqlplus / as sysdba
   
   # If accessible, check SMON status
   SELECT PNAME, PID, SPID, PROGRAM FROM V$PROCESS WHERE PNAME = 'SMON';
   ```

2. **Collect Diagnostic Information:**
   ```sql
   -- Check for corruption
   SELECT * FROM V$DATABASE_BLOCK_CORRUPTION;
   
   -- Review recent errors
   SELECT * FROM V$DIAG_ALERT_EXT WHERE COMPONENT_ID = 'rdbms' 
   AND MESSAGE_TEXT LIKE '%SMON%' ORDER BY ORIGINATING_TIMESTAMP DESC;
   ```

3. **Recovery Strategy:**
   - **If instance is hung:** Perform immediate shutdown abort and startup
   - **If corruption is detected:** Run RMAN validation
   - **If ORA-00600 persists:** 
     - Collect trace files from SMON
     - Set `_smon_internal_errs = 'IGNORE'` temporarily
     - Restart with minimal parameters

4. **Post-Recovery Actions:**
   ```sql
   -- Force SMON cleanup
   ALTER SYSTEM SET "_cleanup_rollback_entries" = 2000;
   
   -- Monitor recovery progress
   SELECT USEG_SIZE, PROGRESS FROM V$FAST_START_TRANSACTIONS;
   ```

### Question 5: PGA Memory Explosion
**Scenario:** Your OLAP workload is consuming excessive PGA memory (PGA_AGGREGATE_TARGET=8GB, but actual usage is 24GB). Some sessions are getting ORA-04030 errors, and server swapping is occurring.

**Answer:** This indicates PGA memory management issues, often caused by poorly tuned queries or inadequate memory configuration.

**Diagnostic Analysis:**
```sql
-- Check PGA usage by session
SELECT s.sid, s.username, s.program, p.pga_used_mem, p.pga_alloc_mem, p.pga_max_mem
FROM v$session s, v$process p 
WHERE s.paddr = p.addr 
ORDER BY p.pga_used_mem DESC;

-- Analyze workarea operations
SELECT operation_type, policy, total_executions, optimal_executions, 
       onepass_executions, multipasses_executions 
FROM v$sql_workarea_histogram;

-- Check PGA target advisor
SELECT * FROM V$PGA_TARGET_ADVICE ORDER BY PGA_TARGET_FOR_ESTIMATE;
```

**Resolution Strategy:**
1. **Immediate Relief:**
   ```sql
   -- Increase PGA target temporarily
   ALTER SYSTEM SET pga_aggregate_target = 16G;
   
   -- Limit workarea size per operation
   ALTER SYSTEM SET workarea_size_policy = MANUAL;
   ALTER SYSTEM SET sort_area_size = 2097152;
   ALTER SYSTEM SET hash_area_size = 2097152;
   ```

2. **Long-term Optimization:**
   - Identify memory-intensive queries using AWR
   - Implement query optimization (proper indexing, partition pruning)
   - Consider increasing server memory or implementing connection pooling
   - Tune `_pga_max_size` parameter for individual sessions

3. **Monitoring Setup:**
   ```sql
   -- Create PGA monitoring job
   BEGIN
     DBMS_SCHEDULER.CREATE_JOB(
       job_name => 'PGA_MONITOR',
       job_type => 'PLSQL_BLOCK',
       job_action => 'BEGIN 
                        IF (SELECT value FROM v$pgastat WHERE name = ''total PGA allocated'') > 20*1024*1024*1024 
                        THEN 
                          DBMS_ALERT.SIGNAL(''PGA_ALERT'', ''PGA usage exceeds 20GB''); 
                        END IF; 
                      END;',
       repeat_interval => 'FREQ=MINUTELY;INTERVAL=5'
     );
   END;
   ```

### Question 6: Shared Pool Fragmentation Crisis
**Scenario:** Your 19c database is experiencing severe shared pool fragmentation. V$SGASTAT shows 89% shared pool utilization, but you're getting ORA-04031 errors during peak hours. Cursor sharing is minimal despite similar queries.

**Answer:** This is a classic shared pool fragmentation issue combined with poor cursor sharing, requiring both immediate relief and long-term optimization.

**Immediate Diagnostic:**
```sql
-- Check shared pool fragmentation
SELECT pool, name, bytes/1024/1024 MB FROM v$sgastat 
WHERE pool = 'shared pool' ORDER BY bytes DESC;

-- Analyze cursor sharing efficiency
SELECT sql_text, version_count, executions, parse_calls, 
       ROUND(parse_calls/executions*100,2) as parse_ratio
FROM v$sql WHERE executions > 100 ORDER BY version_count DESC;

-- Check for memory leaks
SELECT namespace, gets, gethits, pins, pinhits, reloads, invalidations
FROM v$librarycache;
```

**Emergency Resolution:**
1. **Immediate Relief:**
   ```sql
   -- Flush shared pool (use with caution in production)
   ALTER SYSTEM FLUSH SHARED_POOL;
   
   -- Increase shared pool size temporarily
   ALTER SYSTEM SET shared_pool_size = 4G;
   
   -- Enable cursor sharing
   ALTER SYSTEM SET cursor_sharing = FORCE;
   ```

2. **Root Cause Analysis:**
   - Large objects in shared pool (check V$DB_OBJECT_CACHE)
   - Literal SQL queries preventing cursor sharing
   - Memory leaks in Java stored procedures
   - Excessive context switching

3. **Long-term Optimization:**
   ```sql
   -- Implement result cache
   ALTER SYSTEM SET result_cache_mode = FORCE;
   ALTER SYSTEM SET result_cache_max_size = 1G;
   
   -- Tune cursor sharing parameters
   ALTER SYSTEM SET cursor_sharing = EXACT;
   ALTER SYSTEM SET session_cached_cursors = 200;
   
   -- Monitor with advisor
   SELECT * FROM v$shared_pool_advice ORDER BY shared_pool_size_for_estimate;
   ```

## Section B: Patching & Upgrades (Questions 7-12)

### Question 7: Failed RUR Rollback Scenario
**Scenario:** You applied Release Update Revision (RUR) 19.21.0.0.231017 to your production database, but the application is failing with ORA-00600 errors. You need to rollback, but the database won't start after the rollback attempt.

**Answer:** This is a critical situation requiring careful recovery procedures for Oracle RUR rollbacks.

**Pre-Rollback Assessment:**
```sql
-- Check applied patches
SELECT * FROM dba_registry_sqlpatch ORDER BY action_time DESC;

-- Verify patch conflicts
$ORACLE_HOME/OPatch/opatch lsinventory -detail

-- Check for invalid objects
SELECT owner, object_name, object_type, status FROM dba_objects WHERE status = 'INVALID';
```

**Rollback Procedure:**
1. **Shutdown Database Safely:**
   ```sql
   -- Create guaranteed restore point before rollback
   CREATE RESTORE POINT before_rollback_rur GUARANTEE FLASHBACK DATABASE;
   
   SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE;
   ```

2. **Oracle Home Rollback:**
   ```bash
   # Rollback the RUR patch
   cd $ORACLE_HOME/OPatch
   ./opatch rollback -id 35320081
   
   # Verify rollback success
   ./opatch lsinventory | grep -i "interim patches"
   ```

3. **Database Recovery (if startup fails):**
   ```sql
   STARTUP NOMOUNT;
   
   -- Check control file consistency
   SELECT * FROM v$controlfile_record_section WHERE type = 'REDO LOG';
   
   -- If control file issues exist
   RECOVER DATABASE USING BACKUP CONTROLFILE;
   
   -- Apply archive logs
   RECOVER DATABASE;
   
   ALTER DATABASE OPEN RESETLOGS;
   ```

4. **Post-Rollback Validation:**
   ```sql
   -- Run datapatch to sync registry
   $ORACLE_HOME/OPatch/datapatch -verbose
   
   -- Recompile invalid objects
   @$ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin/utlrp.sql
   
   -- Verify database consistency
   SELECT comp_name, version, status FROM dba_registry;
   ```

### Question 8: Cross-Platform Upgrade Complexity
**Scenario:** You're upgrading from Oracle 11.2.0.4 on AIX to Oracle 19c on Linux x86-64. The database is 8TB with partitioned tables, and you have a 6-hour maintenance window. What's your strategy?

**Answer:** This requires a comprehensive cross-platform migration strategy combining upgrade and platform migration.

**Pre-Migration Preparation:**
1. **Compatibility Assessment:**
   ```sql
   -- Check endianness compatibility
   SELECT platform_name, endian_format FROM v$database;
   
   -- Verify transportable tablespace eligibility
   EXEC DBMS_TTS.TRANSPORT_SET_CHECK('USERS,DATA', TRUE);
   SELECT * FROM TRANSPORT_SET_VIOLATIONS;
   
   -- Check character set compatibility
   SELECT * FROM database_properties WHERE property_name LIKE '%CHARACTERSET%';
   ```

2. **Migration Strategy (Hybrid Approach):**
   
   **Option A: Export/Import with Transportable Tablespaces**
   ```bash
   # Export metadata only
   expdp system/password FULL=Y CONTENT=METADATA_ONLY DUMPFILE=full_meta.dmp
   
   # Convert datafiles for large tablespaces
   RMAN> CONVERT TABLESPACE users TO PLATFORM 'Linux x86 64-bit' 
         FORMAT '/backup/converted_%U';
   ```

   **Option B: RMAN Cross-Platform Backup**
   ```bash
   # On source (AIX)
   RMAN> BACKUP DATABASE FORMAT '/backup/db_%U' TAG 'CROSS_PLATFORM';
   
   # On target (Linux) - requires conversion
   RMAN> RESTORE DATABASE FROM TAG 'CROSS_PLATFORM' PREVIEW;
   ```

3. **Recommended Approach for 6-Hour Window:**
   ```bash
   # Phase 1: Preparation (Done offline)
   - Create 19c Linux environment
   - Export/import smaller tablespaces
   - Prepare conversion scripts
   
   # Phase 2: Maintenance Window
   - Final export of remaining data
   - Convert and transport large tablespaces
   - Upgrade to 19c using DBUA
   - Validate and test
   ```

**Execution Steps:**
```sql
-- Step 1: Pre-upgrade checks on 11g
@$ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin/preupgrd.sql

-- Step 2: Transport conversion
BEGIN
  DBMS_FILE_TRANSFER.PUT_FILE(
    source_directory_object => 'DATA_PUMP_DIR',
    source_file_name => 'converted_data.dbf',
    destination_directory_object => 'DATA_PUMP_DIR',
    destination_file_name => 'target_data.dbf'
  );
END;

-- Step 3: Post-upgrade validation
@$ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin/postupgrade_fixups.sql
```

### Question 9: Patch Conflict Resolution
**Scenario:** You're trying to apply October 2023 RU (19.20.0.0.230718) but OPatch reports conflicts with previously applied one-off patches. Three critical business patches cannot be rolled back. How do you proceed?

**Answer:** This requires careful patch conflict analysis and resolution using OPatch merge capabilities.

**Conflict Analysis:**
```bash
# Detailed conflict analysis
$ORACLE_HOME/OPatch/opatch prereq CheckConflictAgainstOHWithDetail -ph 35354406

# List all applied patches
$ORACLE_HOME/OPatch/opatch lsinventory -detail -oh $ORACLE_HOME

# Check patch overlap
$ORACLE_HOME/OPatch/opatch query -all | grep -E "(Patch|Bug)"
```

**Resolution Strategy:**

1. **Identify Superseded Patches:**
   ```bash
   # Check if one-off patches are included in RU
   $ORACLE_HOME/OPatch/opatch prereq CheckConflictAgainstOHWithDetail -ph 35354406 | grep -i "superseded"
   
   # Download patch README to verify inclusions
   # Oracle support note: "How to check if a patch is included in RU/RUR"
   ```

2. **Create Patch Merge (if conflicts exist):**
   ```bash
   # Create temporary directory
   mkdir /tmp/patch_merge
   cd /tmp/patch_merge
   
   # Unzip conflicting patches
   unzip /patches/35354406_19.20.0.0.230718.zip
   unzip /patches/critical_patch_1.zip
   unzip /patches/critical_patch_2.zip
   
   # Merge patches
   $ORACLE_HOME/OPatch/opatch merge -oh $ORACLE_HOME
   ```

3. **Alternative: Staged Application:**
   ```bash
   # Rollback conflicting one-offs temporarily
   $ORACLE_HOME/OPatch/opatch rollback -id <patch_id>
   
   # Apply RU
   $ORACLE_HOME/OPatch/opatch apply 35354406
   
   # Re-apply critical patches if still needed
   $ORACLE_HOME/OPatch/opatch apply <critical_patch_id>
   ```

4. **Post-Application Validation:**
   ```sql
   -- Check patch application status
   SELECT * FROM dba_registry_sqlpatch ORDER BY action_time DESC;
   
   -- Verify functionality
   SELECT comp_name, version, status FROM dba_registry;
   
   -- Run datapatch
   $ORACLE_HOME/OPatch/datapatch -verbose
   ```

### Question 10: Upgrade Failure Recovery
**Scenario:** During a 12c to 19c upgrade using DBUA, the upgrade fails at 85% completion with "ORA-00600: internal error code, arguments: [evapls-00]". The database is in an inconsistent state and won't start normally.

**Answer:** This is a critical upgrade failure requiring careful recovery to restore database functionality.

**Immediate Assessment:**
```bash
# Check DBUA logs
tail -f $ORACLE_BASE/cfgtoollogs/dbua/upgrade<timestamp>/dbua<timestamp>.log

# Check upgrade status
sqlplus / as sysdba
SELECT * FROM registry$history ORDER BY action_time DESC;

# Verify current state
SELECT comp_name, version, status FROM dba_registry;
```

**Recovery Strategy:**

1. **Determine Recovery Options:**
   ```sql
   -- Check if flashback is available
   SELECT flashback_on FROM v$database;
   
   -- List available restore points
   SELECT name, scn, time, guarantee_flashback_database FROM v$restore_point;
   
   -- Check backup availability
   RMAN> LIST BACKUP SUMMARY;
   ```

2. **Option A: Flashback Database (if available):**
   ```sql
   SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE;
   STARTUP MOUNT;
   
   -- Flashback to before upgrade
   FLASHBACK DATABASE TO RESTORE POINT before_upgrade;
   
   ALTER DATABASE OPEN RESETLOGS;
   
   -- Verify 12c functionality
   SELECT banner FROM v$version;
   ```

3. **Option B: Manual Upgrade Continuation:**
   ```sql
   -- Start in upgrade mode
   STARTUP UPGRADE;
   
   -- Check which components failed
   SELECT comp_name, version, status FROM dba_registry WHERE status != 'VALID';
   
   -- Manually run remaining upgrade scripts
   @$ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin/catupgrd.sql
   
   -- Check for specific component issues
   SELECT * FROM registry$error;
   ```

4. **Option C: Restore and Retry:**
   ```bash
   # Restore from backup
   RMAN> SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE;
   RMAN> STARTUP NOMOUNT;
   RMAN> RESTORE CONTROLFILE FROM AUTOBACKUP;
   RMAN> ALTER DATABASE MOUNT;
   RMAN> RESTORE DATABASE;
   RMAN> RECOVER DATABASE;
   RMAN> ALTER DATABASE OPEN;
   ```

**Post-Recovery Actions:**
```sql
-- Clean up failed upgrade artifacts
DELETE FROM sys.registry$history WHERE action_time > TO_DATE('upgrade_start_time');

-- Reset registry components
UPDATE sys.registry$ SET status = 'VALID' WHERE comp_name = 'CATALOG';

-- Recompile all objects
@$ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin/utlrp.sql

-- Verify database consistency
SELECT * FROM v$database_block_corruption;
```

### Question 11: Standby Database Upgrade Challenge
**Scenario:** You have a Data Guard configuration (Primary 12.2, Physical Standby 12.2) that needs to be upgraded to 19c. The business requires zero downtime and the standby must remain in sync throughout the process.

**Answer:** This requires a rolling upgrade strategy using Data Guard's transient logical standby method.

**Rolling Upgrade Strategy:**

1. **Pre-Upgrade Preparation:**
   ```sql
   -- On Primary: Check Data Guard status
   SELECT name, value FROM v$dataguard_stats;
   
   -- Verify standby is in sync
   SELECT thread#, max(sequence#) FROM v$archived_log GROUP BY thread#;
   
   -- On Standby: Check apply lag
   SELECT name, value FROM v$dataguard_stats WHERE name = 'apply lag';
   ```

2. **Phase 1: Convert Standby to Logical Standby:**
   ```sql
   -- On Standby: Stop managed recovery
   ALTER DATABASE RECOVER MANAGED STANDBY DATABASE CANCEL;
   
   -- Prepare for logical standby conversion
   ALTER DATABASE RECOVER TO LOGICAL STANDBY <primary_db_name>;
   
   -- Convert to logical standby
   ALTER DATABASE OPEN READ WRITE;
   ALTER DATABASE START LOGICAL STANDBY APPLY;
   ```

3. **Phase 2: Upgrade Standby to 19c:**
   ```bash
   # Shutdown logical standby
   sqlplus / as sysdba
   SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE;
   
   # Upgrade Oracle Home
   cd /u01/app/oracle/product/19.0.0/dbhome_1
   ./runInstaller -silent -responseFile /tmp/db_upgrade.rsp
   
   # Upgrade database
   ./dbua -silent -responseFile /tmp/dbua_upgrade.rsp
   ```

4. **Phase 3: Switchover and Upgrade Primary:**
   ```sql
   -- On Primary: Prepare for switchover
   ALTER DATABASE COMMIT TO SWITCHOVER TO LOGICAL STANDBY;
   
   -- On Standby (now logical): Complete switchover
   ALTER DATABASE COMMIT TO SWITCHOVER TO PRIMARY;
   
   -- Upgrade original primary (now standby)
   -- Repeat upgrade process
   ```

5. **Phase 4: Convert Back to Physical Standby:**
   ```sql
   -- Create new physical standby from upgraded primary
   RMAN> DUPLICATE TARGET DATABASE FOR STANDBY FROM ACTIVE DATABASE;
   
   -- Start managed recovery
   ALTER DATABASE RECOVER MANAGED STANDBY DATABASE DISCONNECT FROM SESSION;
   ```

**Validation and Monitoring:**
```sql
-- Verify Data Guard status
SELECT database_role, open_mode FROM v$database;

-- Check synchronization
SELECT process, status, sequence# FROM v$managed_standby;

-- Validate upgrade success
SELECT comp_name, version, status FROM dba_registry;
```

### Question 12: Emergency Patch Deployment
**Scenario:** A critical security vulnerability (CVE-2023-XXXX) has been discovered in Oracle Database 19c. You have 200+ databases across multiple environments that need an emergency one-off patch within 24 hours. How do you orchestrate this?

**Answer:** This requires a coordinated mass deployment strategy with proper testing and rollback procedures.

**Mass Deployment Strategy:**

1. **Rapid Assessment and Planning:**
   ```bash
   # Create inventory of all databases
   cat > db_inventory.sql << 'EOF'
   SELECT instance_name, host_name, version, status 
   FROM gv$instance 
   ORDER BY instance_name;
   EOF
   
   # Automated inventory collection
   for host in $(cat db_hosts.txt); do
     ssh oracle@$host "
       export ORACLE_SID=\$(ps -ef | grep smon | grep -v grep | awk '{print \$NF}' | cut -d_ -f3)
       sqlplus -s / as sysdba @db_inventory.sql
     " >> inventory_results.txt
   done
   ```

2. **Automated Patch Deployment Framework:**
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   # emergency_patch_deploy.sh
   
   PATCH_ID="35354789"
   PATCH_FILE="/patches/p${PATCH_ID}_190000_Linux-x86-64.zip"
   
   deploy_patch() {
     local hostname=$1
     local oracle_home=$2
     
     echo "Deploying patch to $hostname:$oracle_home"
     
     # Copy patch to target
     scp $PATCH_FILE oracle@$hostname:/tmp/
     
     # Apply patch
     ssh oracle@$hostname "
       export ORACLE_HOME=$oracle_home
       cd /tmp
       unzip -q p${PATCH_ID}_*.zip
       cd ${PATCH_ID}
       
       # Pre-req check
       \$ORACLE_HOME/OPatch/opatch prereq CheckConflictAgainstOHWithDetail -ph .
       
       if [ \$? -eq 0 ]; then
         # Apply patch
         \$ORACLE_HOME/OPatch/opatch apply -silent
         
         # Run datapatch
         \$ORACLE_HOME/OPatch/datapatch -verbose
       else
         echo 'ERROR: Patch conflicts detected on $hostname'
         exit 1
       fi
     "
   }
   
   # Parallel deployment
   while IFS=',' read -r hostname oracle_home; do
     deploy_patch "$hostname" "$oracle_home" &
   done < db_targets.csv
   
   wait
   ```

3. **Validation and Monitoring:**
   ```bash
   # Post-deployment validation
   validate_patch_deployment() {
     for host in $(cat db_hosts.txt); do
       ssh oracle@$host "
         \$ORACLE_HOME/OPatch/opatch lsinventory | grep -i $PATCH_ID
         if [ \$? -eq 0 ]; then
           echo '$host: SUCCESS'
         else
           echo '$host: FAILED'
         fi
       "
     done
   }
   ```

4. **Rollback Procedure (if needed):**
   ```bash
   # Automated rollback script
   rollback_emergency_patch() {
     local hostname=$1
     
     ssh oracle@$hostname "
       export ORACLE_HOME=\$(cat /etc/oratab | grep -v '^#' | cut -d: -f2 | head -1)
       
       # Rollback patch
       \$ORACLE_HOME/OPatch/opatch rollback -id $PATCH_ID -silent
       
       # Run datapatch
       \$ORACLE_HOME/OPatch/datapatch -verbose
     "
   }
