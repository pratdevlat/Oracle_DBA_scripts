## Risk Management

### High-Risk Items

1. **Data Loss Risk**
- **Mitigation**: Multiple backups, validation at each step
- **Contingency**: Rollback procedures ready
1. **Extended Downtime**
- **Mitigation**: Test migrations, parallel processing
- **Contingency**: Phased migration approach
1. **Application Incompatibility**
- **Mitigation**: Thorough testing, code analysis
- **Contingency**: Compatibility layer, gradual rollout
1. **Performance Degradation**
- **Mitigation**: Performance testing, tuning
- **Contingency**: Hardware upgrade, query optimization
1. **Resource Availability**
- **Mitigation**: Cross-training, documentation
- **Contingency**: External consultants on standby

### Risk Register

|Risk                        |Probability|Impact|Mitigation Strategy              |Owner    |
|----------------------------|-----------|------|---------------------------------|---------|
|Large BLOB migration failure|Medium     |High  |Test separately, use â€“blob_to_lo |DBA      |
|Unsupported Oracle features |High       |Medium|Early identification, workarounds|Architect|
|Network bandwidth issues    |Low        |High  |Off-hours migration, compression |SysAdmin |
|Sequence value mismatch     |Medium     |Medium|Post-migration validation        |DBA      |
|Character encoding problems |Low        |Medium|UTF-8 everywhere, testing        |DBA      |

## Migration Strategies

### Strategy 1: Big Bang Migration (Recommended for <100GB)

- **Approach**: Migrate entire database in one window
- **Downtime**: 4-8 hours
- **Best for**: Smaller databases, simple applications

### Strategy 2: Phased Migration (Recommended for >100GB)

- **Approach**: Migrate in stages (schema first, then data by table groups)
- **Downtime**: Multiple shorter windows
- **Best for**: Large databases, complex dependencies

### Strategy 3: Parallel Run (Recommended for critical systems)

- **Approach**: Run both systems in parallel with sync
- **Downtime**: Minimal (cutover only)
- **Best for**: Mission-critical applications

## Downtime Optimization Techniques

1. **Pre-Migration Tasks** (No downtime)
- Create PostgreSQL schema
- Set up replication/CDC if available
- Pre-copy historical data
1. **Parallel Processing**
   
   ```ini
   PARALLEL_TABLES 8
   JOBS 4
   ORACLE_COPIES 4
   ```
1. **Optimize Data Transfer**
- Use COPY instead of INSERT
- Disable indexes during load
- Use COPY FREEZE for new tables
1. **Post-Migration Tasks** (Can be done online)
- Create non-critical indexes
- Update statistics
- Performance tuning
