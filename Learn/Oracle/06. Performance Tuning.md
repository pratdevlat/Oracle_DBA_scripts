## Chapter 1: Selectivity and Cardinality

Performance tuning is one area where most Junior DBAs face those tough-to-break problems. The kind of problems which require deep understanding of the concepts before you can even point what is going wrong in the system. We will be going through the basics knowledge in the Performance Tuning area in series of posts.

### Selectivity

**Definition**: It represents the fraction of rows filtered by an operation, so you can say it is a measure of uniqueness.

#### Key Characteristics:
- **Range**: Its value is between 0 and 1
- **Calculation**: selectivity = (rows returned after filter) / (total rows before filter)

#### Examples:

**Example 1 - Good Selectivity:**
- Query returned 100 rows initially
- After applying filter (WHERE condition), final result is 10 rows
- Selectivity = 10/100 = 0.1 (or 10%)
- This is **GOOD selectivity** because the filter significantly reduced the result set

**Example 2 - Bad Selectivity:**
- Query returned 200 rows initially  
- After applying filter, final result is still 200 rows
- Selectivity = 200/200 = 1.0 (or 100%)
- This is **BAD selectivity** because the filter didn't reduce the result set at all

#### Selectivity Classifications:

**GOOD Selectivity:**
- A column is highly selective if a SQL returns a small number of duplicate rows
- Means the filter is effective at narrowing down results
- Results in better performance

**BAD Selectivity:**
- A column is least selective if a SQL returns all or large number of rows
- Means the filter is not effective
- Results in poor performance

#### Important Notes:
- When you run `SELECT * FROM EMP` without any filters, selectivity will be automatically 1 as all rows will be returned
- **Adding a composite Index** is the best way to make BAD selectivity become GOOD selectivity
- Using more than one column makes the Index more unique which improves Index selectivity

### Cardinality

**Definition**: The number of rows returned by an operation is the cardinality.

#### Relationship Formula:
```
cardinality = selectivity × number of input rows
```

#### Practical Example:
- Query initially retrieved 200 records from database
- After applying filters, final number of rows is 50
- **Selectivity** = 50/200 = 0.25 (25%)
- **Cardinality** = 50 (or 200 × 0.25 = 50)

#### Impact on Performance:
Sometimes the Oracle optimizer is not able to predict the number of rows that a given operator will return due to reasons like:
- Missing table statistics
- Outdated statistics
- Complex predicates

This can prevent Oracle from estimating the cost of a query plan correctly, which can lead to:
- Selection of suboptimal execution plans
- Cardinality estimation errors
- Slow running queries

### Detailed Examples

#### Example 1: Query Without Filter
```sql
SELECT MAX(EMP_NUMBER) FROM EMP;
```
**Scenario**: Table EMP has 10 records total

**Analysis**:
- **Selectivity** = number of rows accessed / total number of rows = 10/10 = 1.0
- **Interpretation**: 100% of the rows were accessed
- **Cardinality** = number of rows accessed = 10

#### Example 2: Query With Filter  
```sql
SELECT MAX(EMP_NUMBER) FROM EMP WHERE LAST_NAME = 'SMITH';
```
**Scenario**: Only 4 employees have LAST_NAME as 'SMITH' out of 10 total records

**Analysis**:
- **Selectivity** = number of rows accessed / total number of rows = 4/10 = 0.4
- **Interpretation**: 40% of the rows were accessed
- **Cardinality** = number of rows accessed = 4

This demonstrates how adding a selective filter condition improves selectivity from 1.0 to 0.4, making the query more efficient.

## Chapter 2: Parsing

From performance tuning perspectives, it is very important to understand the concept of parsing. Parsing is the primary phase in SQL execution, followed by other stages: Execute and Fetch.

### Parsing Basics

Whenever a SQL statement is executed, the Oracle Engine performs the following actions:

1. **Validate the Syntax** - Check if the SQL statement is syntactically correct
2. **Validate the Objects** - Verify that all objects referenced in the statement exist
3. **Check Privileges** - Ensure the user has necessary privileges to execute the statement
4. **Search Shared Pool** - Verify if the statement is already available in the shared pool by:
   - Oracle engine calculates the hash value for the SQL statement
   - Looks in the shared pool for matching hash
5. **Allocate Memory** - If statement is not present, allocate shared memory and create a cursor in shared pool
6. **Generate Execution Plan** - Create the optimal execution plan for the statement

### Types of Parses

#### Hard Parse

**Definition**: A hard parse occurs when the statement is not available in shared memory or this is a brand new statement that the user is trying to execute.

**When Hard Parse Occurs**:
- Statement has never been executed before
- Statement was aged out of shared pool due to memory pressure
- Statement text doesn't exactly match existing statements (even case sensitivity matters)

**Process**: All parsing steps (1-6 above) need to be completed

**Impact**: 
- Requires extra system resources
- CPU-intensive operation
- Also known as **'Library Cache Miss'**

#### Soft Parse

**Definition**: A soft parse occurs when the statement was executed earlier, was already parsed, and is available in memory.

**Process**: Oracle only needs to perform steps 1-3 (syntax validation, object validation, privilege check) since the remaining tasks were already completed earlier.

**Benefits**:
- Much faster than hard parse
- Minimal resource consumption
- Also known as **'Library Cache Hit'**
- Follows the principle: "work hard once and reap benefits multiple times"

### Why Hard Parses Should Be Avoided

There are two key reasons why hard parses should be kept to the bare minimum required:

#### 1. CPU Intensive Operations
- **Generation of an execution plan is a very CPU-intensive operation**
- Each hard parse consumes significant CPU resources
- High hard parse rates can lead to CPU bottlenecks

#### 2. Memory Serialization Issues
- **Memory in the shared pool is limited**
- **Memory operations are serialized** - they must happen one at a time
- Memory operations use **shared pool latches** and **library cache latches**
- When many hard parses happen simultaneously:
  - Other processes must wait in queue to get the shared pool latch
  - This creates contention and reduces overall system performance
  - Impacts both shared pool latch and library cache latch availability

### Performance Implications

#### Hard Parse Impact:
- High CPU consumption
- Memory contention
- Increased response times
- Reduced throughput
- Latch waits

#### Soft Parse Benefits:
- Low CPU consumption  
- Reduced memory operations
- Faster response times
- Higher throughput
- Better scalability

### Best Practices

1. **Use Bind Variables** - Promotes statement reuse and soft parsing
2. **Consistent SQL Text** - Ensure identical statements have identical text (case, spacing, etc.)
3. **Adequate Shared Pool Size** - Prevent aging out of frequently used statements
4. **Monitor Parse Ratios** - Track hard vs soft parse ratios
5. **Application Design** - Design applications to reuse SQL statements

### Monitoring Parsing

Key metrics to monitor:
- Hard parse rate
- Soft parse rate  
- Parse time CPU vs total CPU
- Library cache hit ratio
- Shared pool latch contention

## Chapter 3: Parent and Child Cursors

### What is a Cursor?

A "cursor" is a memory area in the library cache that is allocated to the SQL statement which users execute. This memory area stores key information about the SQL statement like SQL text, SQL execution plan, statistics etc.

### Why Two Kinds of Cursors?

This is by Oracle database design that you have two kinds of cursors: Parent and Child. For each SQL statement that you execute, Oracle engine will generate two cursors: parent and child cursor. Two cursors are generated because for the same SQL statement, there could be other differences like there can be different bind values or two different schema or different literals values, etc. The parent Cursor will hold the SQL statement and the child cursor will hold the information related to the differences. This essentially makes child cursor as deciding factor as to SQL statement will go for hard or soft parse.

### Parent Cursor

- It stores the SQL text of the cursor. When two statements are identical word-by-word, they will share the same parent Cursor.
- Every parent cursor would execute with at least one child cursor created for it.
- Parent cursors are represented in the view **V$SQLAREA**. VERSION_COUNT column in the v$sqlarea can tell us how many child cursors does this parent cursor have.

### Child Cursor

- Each parent has at least one child cursor and can have more than 1 child cursors also
- While parent cursor stores the SQL Text, the child cursor stores other important information related to SQL statement like:
  - Environment details
  - Statistics details
  - Bind Variables details
  - Execution Plan details
  - Bind Variables details
- Child Cursor takes less memory space as SQL Text is not stored in child cursor
- Every child cursor must belong to a parent
- Child cursor decides whether a query will undergo a hard parse or a soft parse. You may find situation that SQL query is same for two statements so Parent cursors are same but the child cursor is not shareable to SQL goes for hard parse (re-compile).
- Child cursors are represented in the view **V$SQL**
- **V$SQL_SHARED_CURSOR** is very useful view as it provides the reasons why the optimizer decided mark the cursor as un-shared. So anytime you see that SQL statement was same and still hard parse happened, look at this view.

### V$SQL_SHARED_CURSOR View

This view explains why a particular child cursor is not shared with existing child cursors which caused more than one child cursor to be created for same Parent cursor. Each column in this view identifies a specific reason why the cursor cannot be shared. The columns describe the various reasons with "Y" or "N" for the value. You should focus on the column which has value as 'Y'. A specific child may have failed sharing for several reasons – ie: a different reason for trying to use different existing child cursors.

### CURSOR_SHARING Database Parameter

Since we are discussing parent and child cursors, it is very important that we discuss a bit about the cursor_sharing database parameter. CURSOR_SHARING determines what kind of SQL statements can share the same cursors.

cursor_sharing database parameters can have three different values:

#### EXACT
Only allows statements with identical text to share the same cursor.

#### FORCE
Forces statements that may differ in some literals, but are otherwise identical, to share a cursor, unless the literals affect the meaning of the statement.

#### SIMILAR
Causes statements that may differ in some literals, but are otherwise identical, to share a cursor, unless the literals affect either the meaning of the statement or the degree to which the plan is optimized.

### Examples of Different SQL Statements

The default cursor_sharing criteria is EXACT which means that each different SQL statement a new parent cursor is created. Example, below are two different SQL statements:

```sql
select * from EMP WHERE EMP_ID=1;
select * from EMP where EMP_ID=1;
```

These are two different SQLs although both will produce same result. "where" is written in capital letter in first statement while in the second statement it is written in small letters.

Even below two statements are two different SQLs:

```sql
select * from EMP where EMP_ID=1;
select * from EMP where EMP_ID=2;
```

These are different SQLs as literal values (1 and 2) are different. Executing above will create two Parent cursors if cursor_sharing parameter is EXACT.

Whereas, if you put cursor_sharing criteria is FORCE or SIMILAR, executing above two SQLs will generate single Parent cursor. When we do this, Oracle strips out all the literals from the query and replaces them with bind variables in the optimization phase. Please keep in mind that making cursor_sharing is not always an advantage. It can prove bad for SQL performance also as we will discuss in further posts.

## Chapter 4: Bind Variables

### Introduction to Bind Variables

Bind variables are often known as one of the key feature for better SQL query performance. Bind variables as per Oracle documentation is a placeholder in a SQL statement that must be replaced with a valid value or value address for the statement to execute successfully. By using bind variables, you can write a SQL statement that accepts inputs or parameters at run time.

You can think of SQL query as a kind of "function" in any programming language and bind variables as "values" that you pass to the function.

### Example

```sql
-- Without bind variable (using literal)
Select * from EMP where EMP_ID=1;

-- With bind variable
Select * from EMP where EMP_ID=:a;
```

First statement uses a literal value (1) to run the query while the second SQL statement uses bind variable (:a) to run the SQL statement. The value of (:a) will be provide to Oracle at run time.

### Key Benefits of Bind Variables

Having bind variable defined in the SQL query instead of literal values (which can be different every time) will make sure that Oracle will create only one Parent Cursor for the SQL statement. Oracle look for exact text match for the SQL statement to see if it is already present in the shared pool and having a bind variable instead of literal value will save a costly hard parse every time same SQL is executed.

Bind variables are specially important in OLTP kind of environments as using bind variables enables soft parsing, which means that less processing time is spent on choosing an optimized execution plan.

### Creating Bind Variables in SQL*Plus

You create bind variables in SQL*Plus with the VARIABLE command. Example:

```sql
VARIABLE mybindVariable VARCHAR2(10)
```

### Advantages of Using Bind Variables

1. **Better Shared Pool Utilization**: Oracle Shared Pool has to hold only one statement rather than a potentially very high number.

2. **No Hard Parsing so Better Performance**: No hard parsing required for SQL statements that only differ in the values.

3. **Reduced "library cache" latch contention**: Bind variables helps in avoiding performance problems due to library cache latch contention which happens every time a hard parse is required.

### Disadvantages of Using Bind Variables

Now coming to disadvantages of using bind variables. Note that in many cases bind variables will prove excellent for improving the performance of the database but at time it may produce negative results. Bind variables can reduce the information to calculate optimal access path for (Cost Based Optimizer) CBO.

## Overview

### What is Oracle Trace?
**Trace** is an Oracle feature that generates a raw text file containing internal SQL activity when a program is executed. It provides detailed statistics for performance analysis and troubleshooting.

**Key Information Captured:**
- Parse, execute, and fetch counts
- CPU and elapsed times
- Physical reads and logical reads
- Number of rows processed
- Library cache misses
- Username under each parse occurred
- Commit and rollback operations
- Wait events (when enabled)

### What is TKPROF?
**TKPROF** reformats raw trace data into a readable format for performance analysis. It doesn't control trace contents but makes analysis easier.

**Two Essential Goals:**
1. Identify SQL/Operations taking the highest time
2. Identify SQL/Operations consuming the highest resources

---

## Prerequisites and Key Parameters

### Essential Database Parameters

```sql
-- Enable timing statistics
ALTER SYSTEM SET TIMED_STATISTICS = TRUE;

-- Allow unlimited trace file size
ALTER SYSTEM SET MAX_DUMP_FILE_SIZE = UNLIMITED;

-- Comprehensive statistics collection
ALTER SYSTEM SET STATISTICS_LEVEL = ALL;
```

**Parameter Details:**
- **TIMED_STATISTICS**: Must be TRUE for meaningful timing data
- **MAX_DUMP_FILE_SIZE**: Prevents truncated trace files
- **STATISTICS_LEVEL**: ALL provides most comprehensive information

### Trace Levels Overview

| Level | Description | Use Case |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | Standard SQL Trace | Basic tracing |
| 4 | Includes Bind Variables | When bind values needed |
| 8 | **With Waits (Recommended)** | **Default choice - shows wait events** |
| 12 | Binds + Waits | Comprehensive but overhead-heavy |
| 16 | STAT lines for each execution | Equivalent to plan_stat=ALL_EXECUTIONS |

## Part 1: Trace Generation Methods

### 1. Session-Level Tracing

#### Basic SQL_TRACE
```sql
-- Enable trace for current session
ALTER SESSION SET SQL_TRACE = TRUE;

-- Disable trace
ALTER SESSION SET SQL_TRACE = FALSE;

-- 11g+ Event Syntax
ALTER SESSION SET EVENTS 'sql_trace bind=true';
ALTER SESSION SET EVENTS 'sql_trace bind=true, wait=true';
```

#### 10046 Event Tracing (Recommended)
```sql
-- Level 1 (Basic)
ALTER SESSION SET EVENTS '10046 trace name context forever';

-- Level 8 (With Waits - Recommended)
ALTER SESSION SET EVENTS '10046 trace name context forever, level 8';

-- Level 12 (Binds and Waits)
ALTER SESSION SET EVENTS '10046 trace name context forever, level 12';

-- Disable tracing
ALTER SESSION SET EVENTS '10046 trace name context off';
```

### 2. SQL_ID Specific Tracing (11g+)
```sql
-- Single SQL_ID
ALTER SYSTEM SET EVENTS 'sql_trace [sql: sql_id=4k1jlmn567cr7] bind=true, wait=true';

-- Multiple SQL_IDs
ALTER SYSTEM SET EVENTS 'sql_trace [sql: sql_id=5t6ygtsa3d356|6fa43fgg0rrtp] bind=true, wait=true';
```

### 3. Database-Level Tracing
```sql
-- System-wide (Use with caution!)
ALTER SYSTEM SET SQL_TRACE = TRUE;
ALTER SYSTEM SET EVENTS '10046 trace name context forever, level 8';

-- Disable system-wide
ALTER SYSTEM SET SQL_TRACE = FALSE;
ALTER SYSTEM SET EVENTS '10046 trace name context off';
```

**Warning:** System-wide tracing creates significant overhead. Use only for short periods in controlled environments.

### 4. DBMS_MONITOR Package

#### Session Tracing
```sql
-- Enable for specific session
EXEC DBMS_MONITOR.SESSION_TRACE_ENABLE(
  session_id => &SESSION_ID, 
  serial_num => &SERIAL_NUM, 
  waits => TRUE, 
  binds => FALSE
);

-- Disable for specific session
EXEC DBMS_MONITOR.SESSION_TRACE_DISABLE(
  session_id => &SESSION_ID, 
  serial_num => &SERIAL_NUM
);
```

#### Client ID Tracing
```sql
-- Enable for client identifier
EXEC DBMS_MONITOR.CLIENT_ID_TRACE_ENABLE(
  client_id => 'client_identifier',
  waits => TRUE,
  binds => FALSE
);

-- Disable
EXEC DBMS_MONITOR.CLIENT_ID_TRACE_DISABLE(
  client_id => 'client_identifier'
);
```

### 5. DBMS_SESSION Package
```sql
-- Find session details
SELECT sid, serial#, username, program 
FROM v$session 
WHERE username = 'TARGET_USER';

-- Enable tracing
EXEC DBMS_SESSION.SET_SQL_TRACE_IN_SESSION(&SID, &SERIAL#, TRUE);

-- Disable tracing
EXEC DBMS_SESSION.SET_SQL_TRACE_IN_SESSION(&SID, &SERIAL#, FALSE);
```

### 6. ORADEBUG Utility

**Steps:**
1. **Find Process Information:**
```sql
SELECT p.PID, p.SPID, s.SID 
FROM v$process p, v$session s 
WHERE s.paddr = p.addr 
AND s.sid = &SESSION_ID;
```

2. **Apply Trace:**
```sql
CONNECT / AS SYSDBA
ORADEBUG SETOSPID &SPID
ORADEBUG UNLIMIT
ORADEBUG EVENT 10046 TRACE NAME CONTEXT FOREVER, LEVEL 8
```

3. **Disable Trace:**
```sql
ORADEBUG EVENT 10046 TRACE NAME CONTEXT OFF
```

### 7. User-Level Tracing with Triggers
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER SYS.set_trace 
AFTER LOGON ON DATABASE 
WHEN (USER like '&USERNAME') 
DECLARE 
  lcommand varchar(200); 
BEGIN 
  EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'ALTER SESSION SET TRACEFILE_IDENTIFIER=''From_Trigger'''; 
  EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'ALTER SESSION SET STATISTICS_LEVEL=ALL'; 
  EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'ALTER SESSION SET MAX_DUMP_FILE_SIZE=UNLIMITED'; 
  EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'ALTER SESSION SET EVENTS ''10046 trace name context forever, level 8'''; 
END set_trace;
/
```

### 8. AUTOTRACE in SQL*Plus
```sql
-- Show execution plan only
SET AUTOTRACE TRACEONLY EXPLAIN

-- Show statistics only
SET AUTOTRACE TRACEONLY STATISTICS

-- Show both
SET AUTOTRACE TRACEONLY

-- Show results + plan + statistics
SET AUTOTRACE ON
```

---

## Trace File Locations and Naming

### File Locations

**Pre-11g:**
- User sessions: `user_dump_dest`
- Background processes: `background_dump_dest`

**11g and Later:**
```sql
-- Find trace directory
SELECT value FROM V$DIAG_INFO WHERE NAME = 'Diag Trace';
```
Location: `<diagnostic_dest>/diag/rdbms/<dbname>/<instname>/trace`

### File Naming Convention
Format: `<instance>_ora_<ospid>_<identifier>.trc`

**Components:**
- `<instance>`: Database instance name
- `<ospid>`: OS Process ID from v$process.spid
- `<identifier>`: Trace file identifier

---

---

## Part 3: Analyzing TKPROF Files

### TKPROF File Structure

#### 1. Header Section
- TKPROF version and generation time
- Source trace file name
- Sort options used
- Column definitions

#### 2. Body Section (Main Analysis Area)
Each SQL statement contains:
- SQL text
- Parse/Execute/Fetch statistics
- Library cache information
- Row source execution plan
- Wait events (if available)

#### 3. Summary Section
- Overall statistics
- Recursive vs non-recursive SQL
- Library cache hit ratios
- Total elapsed time

### Understanding Body Section Metrics

#### Performance Metrics Table

| Metric | Unit | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **count** | Number | Times parsed, executed, or fetched |
| **cpu** | Seconds | CPU time consumed |
| **elapsed** | Seconds | Total elapsed time |
| **disk** | Blocks | Physical reads from disk |
| **query** | Blocks | Logical reads (consistent mode) |
| **current** | Blocks | Logical reads (current mode) |
| **rows** | Number | Rows processed |

#### Call Types Explained

| Call Type | Description | When It Occurs |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Parse** | SQL parsing and optimization | First time SQL is seen |
| **Execute** | Statement execution | Every execution |
| **Fetch** | Row retrieval | SELECT statements only |

### Key Analysis Techniques

#### 1. Identify Performance Issues
```
Look for:
- High elapsed times
- High CPU consumption
- Excessive physical reads (disk)
- High parse counts
- Poor fetch patterns
```

#### 2. Parse Analysis
```
Hard Parse Indicators:
- Misses in library cache during parse = 1
- High parse times
- Parse count close to execute count

Soft Parse (Good):
- Misses in library cache during parse = 0
- Low parse times
- Parse count << execute count
```

#### 3. I/O Analysis
```
Physical vs Logical Reads:
- High disk reads = I/O bound
- High query/current = Memory intensive
- Buffer Cache Hit Ratio = 1 - (disk/(query+current))

Target: >95% hit ratio in most cases
```

#### 4. Row Source Operations
```sql
-- Example execution plan output
Rows (1st) Rows (avg) Rows (max)  Row Source Operation
---------- ---------- ----------  -------------------
         1          1          1  UPDATE CUSTOMERS (cr=4 pr=0 pw=0 time=0 us)
         1          1          1   INDEX UNIQUE SCAN CUSTOMERS_PK (cr=3 pr=0 pw=0 time=0 us)
```

**Row Source Metrics:**
- **cr**: Consistent reads (query mode)
- **pr**: Physical reads
- **pw**: Physical writes
- **time**: Time in microseconds

### Summary Section Analysis

#### Library Cache Hit Ratio Calculation
```
Physical reads = sum(disk)
Logical reads = sum(query + current)
Hit Ratio = 1 - (Physical Reads / Logical Reads)

Target: > 95% for most applications
```

#### Key Summary Metrics
- **Parse efficiency**: Total parses vs total SQL statements
- **Fetch efficiency**: Fetches vs rows returned
- **Overall elapsed time**: Total time for all operations

### Wait Events Analysis (Level 8+ Traces)

| Wait Event | Meaning | Action |
|------------|---------|--------|
| **db file sequential read** | Single block reads | Check index usage, disk I/O |
| **db file scattered read** | Multi-block reads | Full table scans |
| **latch: shared pool** | Library cache contention | Reduce hard parsing |
| **enq: TX - row lock contention** | Row locking issues | Application logic review |

   - Parse efficiency
   - Wait events
   - Execution plans

### 4. Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Symptom | Solution |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **Over-parsing** | Parse count ≈ Execute count | Use bind variables |
| **Full table scans** | High "disk" reads | Add/modify indexes |
| **Inefficient joins** | High row counts in plans | Review join order |
| **Lock contention** | High TX wait events | Review transaction logic |

### 5. Additional Analysis Tools

#### SQL Performance Scripts
```sql
-- Find expensive SQL by elapsed time
SELECT sql_id, elapsed_time, executions, 
       elapsed_time/executions avg_elapsed
FROM v$sql 
WHERE executions > 0
ORDER BY elapsed_time DESC;

-- Check current sessions with tracing
SELECT s.sid, s.serial#, s.username, s.program,
       p.tracefile
FROM v$session s, v$process p
WHERE s.paddr = p.addr
AND s.sql_trace = 'enabled';
```

#### Monitoring Queries
```sql
-- Find trace files by session
SELECT s.sid, s.serial#, s.username,
       p.spid, p.tracefile
FROM v$session s, v$process p  
WHERE s.paddr = p.addr
AND s.sid = &SESSION_ID;

-- Check enabled traces
SELECT trace_type, primary_id, qualifier_id1, 
       waits, binds 
FROM dba_enabled_traces;
```

### 6. Advanced Techniques

#### Custom TKPROF Analysis
```bash
# Create custom analysis script
tkprof input.trc output.out sort=fchela,exeela,prsela sys=no | \
grep -E "(elapsed|CPU|disk)" > performance_summary.txt

# Extract only top SQLs
tkprof input.trc output.out print=5 sort=exeela sys=no
```

#### Automated Analysis
```sql
-- PL/SQL block for automated trace analysis
DECLARE
  v_tracefile VARCHAR2(500);
  v_sql VARCHAR2(1000);
BEGIN
  SELECT p.tracefile INTO v_tracefile
  FROM v$session s, v$process p
  WHERE s.paddr = p.addr
  AND s.sid = SYS_CONTEXT('userenv','sid');
  
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Trace file: ' || v_tracefile);
  
  -- Enable tracing
  EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'ALTER SESSION SET EVENTS ''10046 trace name context forever, level 8''';
  
  -- Your SQL operations here
  
  -- Disable tracing  
  EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'ALTER SESSION SET EVENTS ''10046 trace name context off''';
END;
/
```

### 7. Security and Considerations

- **Sensitive Data**: Level 12 traces contain bind variables (potential sensitive data)
- **File System Impact**: Large traces can fill disk space
- **Performance Overhead**: Tracing adds 5-10% overhead
- **Production Use**: Always coordinate with stakeholders
- **Cleanup**: Establish trace file retention policies

### 8. Troubleshooting Common Issues

| Problem | Possible Cause | Solution |
|---------|----------------|----------|
| **No trace file generated** | Wrong parameters/permissions | Check diagnostic_dest, permissions |
| **Empty TKPROF** | Trace disabled prematurely | Verify trace duration |
| **Missing wait events** | Trace level < 8 | Use level 8 or 12 |
| **Huge trace files** | Long-running operations | Use print parameter, monitor size |

---

## Summary

Oracle trace and TKPROF are powerful tools for database performance analysis. Key takeaways:

1. **Use Level 8 tracing** (with waits) for most scenarios
2. **Sort TKPROF output** by elapsed time for efficiency
3. **Focus on high-impact SQLs** first
4. **Analyze parse efficiency** to identify optimization opportunities
5. **Monitor wait events** to understand bottlenecks
6. **Clean up trace files** regularly to prevent space issues

The combination of proper tracing methodology and systematic TKPROF analysis provides deep insights into database performance issues and guides effective optimization strategies.



## Chapter 6: Optimizer Mode - Advanced Deep Dive

### Introduction to Oracle Cost-Based Optimizer (CBO)

The Oracle Cost-Based Optimizer is a sophisticated component that uses mathematical models and statistical analysis to determine the most efficient execution path for SQL statements. It replaced the older Rule-Based Optimizer (RBO) and represents the evolution of Oracle's query optimization technology.

#### CBO Architecture Components

1. **Query Transformer**: Rewrites queries for better performance
2. **Estimator**: Calculates costs, cardinalities, and selectivities
3. **Plan Generator**: Creates alternative execution plans
4. **Plan Selector**: Chooses the plan with the lowest cost

#### Cost Calculation Formula
```
Cost = (CPU_Cost / CPU_SPEED) + (IO_Cost / IO_SPEED)
```

Where:
- CPU_Cost = Number of CPU operations required
- IO_Cost = Number of I/O operations required
- CPU_SPEED and IO_SPEED are system-dependent factors

### Detailed Analysis of Optimizer Modes

#### 1. FIRST_ROWS Mode - Deep Analysis

**Technical Implementation:**
- Uses a modified cost formula that heavily weights early row retrieval
- Prefers nested loop joins over hash joins
- Favors index range scans over full table scans
- Applies different costing for sorting operations

**Mathematical Model:**
```
First_Rows_Cost = α × Initial_Response_Cost + β × Total_Cost
```
Where α > β, giving higher weight to initial response time.

**Use Cases and Scenarios:**
- Interactive applications with pagination
- OLTP systems with user interfaces
- Applications using ROWNUM or FETCH FIRST clauses
- Real-time dashboards requiring immediate feedback

**Performance Characteristics:**
```sql
-- Example showing FIRST_ROWS behavior
SELECT /*+ FIRST_ROWS */ employee_id, employee_name, salary
FROM employees 
WHERE department_id = 10
ORDER BY salary DESC;

-- Typical execution plan characteristics:
-- 1. INDEX RANGE SCAN (instead of FULL TABLE SCAN)
-- 2. NESTED LOOPS (instead of HASH JOIN)
-- 3. SORT ORDER BY STOPKEY (optimized sorting)
```

**Potential Drawbacks:**
- Higher overall resource consumption
- Increased elapsed time for complete result sets
- May create more expensive plans for batch operations

#### 2. FIRST_ROWS_N Mode - Precision Optimization

**Algorithm Details:**
The optimizer uses a cost model that specifically optimizes for retrieving exactly N rows:

```sql
-- Different N values produce different optimization strategies
SELECT /*+ FIRST_ROWS(1) */ * FROM large_table WHERE condition;   -- Single row optimization
SELECT /*+ FIRST_ROWS(10) */ * FROM large_table WHERE condition;  -- Small batch optimization
SELECT /*+ FIRST_ROWS(100) */ * FROM large_table WHERE condition; -- Medium batch optimization
SELECT /*+ FIRST_ROWS(1000) */ * FROM large_table WHERE condition;-- Large batch optimization
```

**Optimization Strategies by N Value:**

| N Value | Primary Strategy | Secondary Strategy | Join Method |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| 1 | Unique index access | Range scan with ROWNUM | Nested loop |
| 10 | Index range scan | Partial sort | Nested loop |
| 100 | Index/partial scan | Hash join (small) | Hash/Nested |
| 1000+ | Mixed approach | Full optimization | All methods |

**Advanced Example:**
```sql
-- Analyzing the impact of different N values
EXPLAIN PLAN FOR
SELECT /*+ FIRST_ROWS(1) */ e.employee_id, e.name, d.department_name
FROM employees e, departments d
WHERE e.department_id = d.department_id
  AND e.salary > 50000;

-- vs.

EXPLAIN PLAN FOR
SELECT /*+ FIRST_ROWS(1000) */ e.employee_id, e.name, d.department_name
FROM employees e, departments d
WHERE e.department_id = d.department_id
  AND e.salary > 50000;
```

#### 3. ALL_ROWS Mode - Throughput Optimization

**Core Philosophy:**
Minimizes total system resources (CPU + I/O) required to complete the entire query.

**Optimization Techniques:**
- **Parallel Processing**: Automatically considers parallel execution
- **Hash Joins**: Prefers hash joins for large data sets
- **Full Table Scans**: Uses FTS when it's more efficient than index access
- **Sort-Merge Joins**: Utilizes when beneficial for large sorted datasets

**Resource Management:**
```sql
-- ALL_ROWS mode resource allocation example
SELECT /*+ ALL_ROWS PARALLEL(e,4) PARALLEL(d,4) */ 
       e.employee_id, e.name, d.department_name, SUM(s.salary_amount)
FROM employees e, departments d, salary_history s
WHERE e.department_id = d.department_id
  AND e.employee_id = s.employee_id
  AND s.salary_date >= '2023-01-01'
GROUP BY e.employee_id, e.name, d.department_name;
```

**Cost Model Differences:**
```
ALL_ROWS_Cost = Total_CPU_Cost + Total_IO_Cost + Parallel_Overhead
FIRST_ROWS_Cost = Weighted_Initial_Cost + Reduced_Total_Cost
```

### Advanced Optimizer Mode Configuration

#### System-Level Optimization

**Instance-Wide Settings:**
```sql
-- Set optimizer mode with additional parameters
ALTER SYSTEM SET optimizer_mode = 'ALL_ROWS' SCOPE=BOTH;
ALTER SYSTEM SET optimizer_index_cost_adj = 10 SCOPE=BOTH;
ALTER SYSTEM SET optimizer_index_caching = 90 SCOPE=BOTH;

-- Monitor the changes
SELECT name, value, isdefault, ismodified 
FROM v$parameter 
WHERE name LIKE 'optimizer%';
```

**Advanced Parameter Tuning:**
```sql
-- Fine-tune optimizer behavior
ALTER SYSTEM SET optimizer_dynamic_sampling = 4;  -- Increased sampling for better statistics
ALTER SYSTEM SET optimizer_adaptive_features = TRUE;  -- Enable adaptive optimizations
ALTER SYSTEM SET optimizer_adaptive_plans = TRUE;     -- Enable adaptive plans
```

#### Session-Level Customization

**Complex Session Configuration:**
```sql
-- Comprehensive session setup for different workload types
-- OLTP Workload Configuration
ALTER SESSION SET optimizer_mode = FIRST_ROWS;
ALTER SESSION SET optimizer_index_cost_adj = 10;
ALTER SESSION SET cursor_sharing = EXACT;
ALTER SESSION SET optimizer_use_invisible_indexes = FALSE;

-- Data Warehouse Configuration  
ALTER SESSION SET optimizer_mode = ALL_ROWS;
ALTER SESSION SET parallel_degree_policy = ADAPTIVE;
ALTER SESSION SET optimizer_adaptive_features = TRUE;
ALTER SESSION SET "_optimizer_use_feedback" = TRUE;
```

#### Application-Specific Optimizer Configuration

**Using Database Services:**
```sql
-- Create service for OLTP workload
BEGIN
  DBMS_SERVICE.CREATE_SERVICE(
    service_name => 'OLTP_SERVICE',
    network_name => 'OLTP_SERVICE'
  );
  
  -- Set optimizer preferences for the service
  DBMS_SERVICE.MODIFY_SERVICE(
    service_name => 'OLTP_SERVICE',
    parameter_name => 'OPTIMIZER_MODE',
    parameter_value => 'FIRST_ROWS'
  );
END;
/
```

**Logon Triggers for User-Based Optimization:**
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER optimize_by_user
AFTER LOGON ON DATABASE
DECLARE
  v_username VARCHAR2(30) := USER;
BEGIN
  CASE 
    WHEN v_username LIKE 'APP_%' THEN
      EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'ALTER SESSION SET optimizer_mode = FIRST_ROWS';
      EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'ALTER SESSION SET optimizer_index_cost_adj = 10';
      
    WHEN v_username LIKE 'ETL_%' THEN
      EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'ALTER SESSION SET optimizer_mode = ALL_ROWS';
      EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'ALTER SESSION SET parallel_degree_policy = ADAPTIVE';
      
    WHEN v_username LIKE 'RPT_%' THEN
      EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'ALTER SESSION SET optimizer_mode = ALL_ROWS';
      EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'ALTER SESSION SET optimizer_adaptive_features = TRUE';
      
    ELSE
      NULL; -- Use default settings
  END CASE;
  
  -- Log the optimization choice
  INSERT INTO optimizer_audit_log (username, login_time, optimizer_mode)
  VALUES (v_username, SYSDATE, SYS_CONTEXT('USERENV', 'OPTIMIZER_MODE'));
  COMMIT;
END;
/
```

### Monitoring and Troubleshooting Optimizer Behavior

#### Real-Time Monitoring Queries

**Current Session Optimizer Settings:**
```sql
-- Comprehensive optimizer configuration view
SELECT 
    s.sid,
    s.serial#,
    s.username,
    s.program,
    p.name AS parameter_name,
    p.value AS parameter_value,
    p.isdefault,
    p.ismodified
FROM v$session s,
     v$parameter p
WHERE s.sid = SYS_CONTEXT('USERENV', 'SID')
  AND p.name IN ('optimizer_mode', 'optimizer_index_cost_adj', 
                 'optimizer_index_caching', 'optimizer_dynamic_sampling')
ORDER BY p.name;
```

**Execution Plan Analysis:**
```sql
-- Analyze execution plans by optimizer mode
SELECT 
    sql_id,
    plan_hash_value,
    optimizer_mode,
    optimizer_cost,
    executions,
    elapsed_time/executions/1000000 as avg_elapsed_sec,
    buffer_gets/executions as avg_buffer_gets,
    disk_reads/executions as avg_disk_reads
FROM v$sql
WHERE optimizer_mode IS NOT NULL
  AND executions > 0
ORDER BY avg_elapsed_sec DESC;
```

#### Performance Impact Assessment

**Before/After Analysis Framework:**
```sql
-- Create performance baseline
CREATE TABLE optimizer_baseline AS
SELECT 
    sql_id,
    plan_hash_value,
    optimizer_mode,
    executions,
    elapsed_time,
    cpu_time,
    buffer_gets,
    disk_reads,
    SYSDATE as baseline_date
FROM v$sql
WHERE last_active_time > SYSDATE - 1;

-- Compare performance after optimizer mode changes
SELECT 
    b.sql_id,
    b.optimizer_mode as old_mode,
    s.optimizer_mode as new_mode,
    ROUND((s.elapsed_time/s.executions)/(b.elapsed_time/b.executions), 2) as elapsed_ratio,
    ROUND((s.buffer_gets/s.executions)/(b.buffer_gets/b.executions), 2) as buffer_ratio,
    ROUND((s.disk_reads/s.executions)/(b.disk_reads/b.executions), 2) as disk_ratio
FROM optimizer_baseline b,
     v$sql s
WHERE b.sql_id = s.sql_id
  AND b.optimizer_mode != s.optimizer_mode
  AND s.executions > 10
ORDER BY elapsed_ratio DESC;
```

### Best Practices and Advanced Techniques

#### Workload Classification Framework

**Automatic Workload Classification:**
```sql
-- Create workload classification function
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION classify_workload(
    p_sql_text CLOB,
    p_rows_processed NUMBER,
    p_executions NUMBER
) RETURN VARCHAR2 IS
    v_classification VARCHAR2(20);
BEGIN
    -- Rule-based classification
    IF UPPER(p_sql_text) LIKE '%SELECT%' AND 
       UPPER(p_sql_text) LIKE '%ROWNUM%' THEN
        v_classification := 'OLTP_PAGINATION';
    ELSIF p_rows_processed / p_executions > 10000 THEN
        v_classification := 'BATCH_PROCESSING';
    ELSIF UPPER(p_sql_text) LIKE '%GROUP BY%' OR 
          UPPER(p_sql_text) LIKE '%ORDER BY%' THEN
        v_classification := 'ANALYTICAL';
    ELSE
        v_classification := 'OLTP_STANDARD';
    END IF;
    
    RETURN v_classification;
END;
/

-- Apply classification to recommend optimizer mode
SELECT 
    sql_id,
    classify_workload(sql_fulltext, rows_processed, executions) as workload_type,
    CASE classify_workload(sql_fulltext, rows_processed, executions)
        WHEN 'OLTP_PAGINATION' THEN 'FIRST_ROWS_10'
        WHEN 'BATCH_PROCESSING' THEN 'ALL_ROWS'
        WHEN 'ANALYTICAL' THEN 'ALL_ROWS'
        ELSE 'FIRST_ROWS'
    END as recommended_optimizer_mode,
    optimizer_mode as current_mode
FROM v$sql
WHERE executions > 5
  AND last_active_time > SYSDATE - 1;
```

## Chapter 7: Trace File Analyzer (TRCA) - Complete Implementation Guide

### TRCA Architecture and Components

#### Internal Architecture

**TRCA System Components:**
1. **TRCANLZR Schema**: Core analysis engine
2. **Trace Parser**: Interprets raw trace files
3. **Statistics Collector**: Gathers database metadata
4. **Report Generator**: Produces HTML/Text outputs
5. **Performance Repository**: Stores historical analysis data

**Database Objects Created:**
```sql
-- Key TRCA objects (created during installation)
SELECT object_name, object_type, status 
FROM dba_objects 
WHERE owner = 'TRCANLZR'
ORDER BY object_type, object_name;

-- Sample output includes:
-- TRCA$_TRACE_FILES (Table)
-- TRCA$_SQL_STATEMENTS (Table)  
-- TRCA$_EXECUTION_PLANS (Table)
-- TRCA_PKG (Package)
-- Various views and indexes
```

### Advanced Installation and Configuration

#### Pre-Installation Assessment

**System Requirements Check:**
```sql
-- Check database version compatibility
SELECT banner FROM v$version WHERE banner LIKE 'Oracle%';

-- Verify available tablespace space
SELECT 
    tablespace_name,
    ROUND(bytes/1024/1024, 2) as size_mb,
    ROUND(maxbytes/1024/1024, 2) as max_size_mb,
    ROUND((bytes - NVL(free_bytes, 0))/1024/1024, 2) as used_mb,
    ROUND(NVL(free_bytes, 0)/1024/1024, 2) as free_mb
FROM (
    SELECT 
        df.tablespace_name,
        SUM(df.bytes) as bytes,
        SUM(df.maxbytes) as maxbytes,
        SUM(fs.bytes) as free_bytes
    FROM dba_data_files df,
         (SELECT tablespace_name, SUM(bytes) as bytes 
          FROM dba_free_space GROUP BY tablespace_name) fs
    WHERE df.tablespace_name = fs.tablespace_name(+)
    GROUP BY df.tablespace_name
)
WHERE tablespace_name NOT IN ('SYSTEM', 'SYSAUX');
```

**Installation Parameter Optimization:**
```sql
-- Create dedicated tablespace for TRCA
CREATE TABLESPACE TRCA_DATA
DATAFILE '/u01/oradata/ORCL/trca_data01.dbf' SIZE 500M
AUTOEXTEND ON NEXT 100M MAXSIZE 2G
EXTENT MANAGEMENT LOCAL
SEGMENT SPACE MANAGEMENT AUTO;

CREATE TABLESPACE TRCA_TEMP
TEMPFILE '/u01/oradata/ORCL/trca_temp01.dbf' SIZE 100M
AUTOEXTEND ON NEXT 50M MAXSIZE 1G;
```

#### Detailed Installation Process

**Enhanced Installation Script:**
```sql
-- Enhanced TRCA installation with custom parameters
-- File: enhanced_tacreate.sql

-- Set installation parameters
DEFINE trca_password = 'SecurePassword123'
DEFINE trca_tablespace = 'TRCA_DATA'
DEFINE trca_temp_tablespace = 'TRCA_TEMP'
DEFINE trca_user = 'APPS'
DEFINE staging_objects = 'T'

-- Execute installation with parameters
@tacreate.sql

-- Post-installation verification
SELECT username, account_status, default_tablespace, temporary_tablespace
FROM dba_users 
WHERE username = 'TRCANLZR';

-- Verify granted roles and privileges
SELECT grantee, granted_role, admin_option
FROM dba_role_privs
WHERE grantee = 'TRCANLZR'
UNION ALL
SELECT grantee, privilege, admin_option
FROM dba_sys_privs
WHERE grantee = 'TRCANLZR'
ORDER BY 2;
```

### Comprehensive Trace Analysis Workflow

#### Advanced Trace Generation

**Multi-Level Trace Generation:**
```sql
-- Session-level trace with enhanced information
ALTER SESSION SET events '10046 trace name context forever, level 12';
ALTER SESSION SET timed_statistics = TRUE;
ALTER SESSION SET statistics_level = ALL;
ALTER SESSION SET max_dump_file_size = UNLIMITED;

-- Execute target SQL
SELECT /*+ FULL(e) FULL(d) USE_HASH(e,d) */ 
       e.employee_id, e.first_name, e.last_name, d.department_name
FROM hr.employees e, hr.departments d
WHERE e.department_id = d.department_id
  AND e.hire_date >= DATE '2020-01-01';

-- Disable tracing
ALTER SESSION SET events '10046 trace name context off';
```

**System-Level Trace for Multiple Sessions:**
```sql
-- Enable tracing for specific module
BEGIN
    DBMS_MONITOR.SERV_MOD_ACT_TRACE_ENABLE(
        service_name => 'ORCL',
        module_name  => 'MYAPP',
        action_name  => 'REPORT_GENERATION',
        waits        => TRUE,
        binds        => TRUE,
        plan_stat    => 'ALL_EXECUTIONS'
    );
END;
/

-- Disable module tracing
BEGIN
    DBMS_MONITOR.SERV_MOD_ACT_TRACE_DISABLE(
        service_name => 'ORCL',
        module_name  => 'MYAPP',
        action_name  => 'REPORT_GENERATION'
    );
END;
/
```

#### Advanced TRCA Execution

**Batch Processing Multiple Traces:**
```sql
-- Create batch processing script
-- File: batch_trca_analysis.sql

SET SERVEROUTPUT ON
DECLARE
    CURSOR c_trace_files IS
        SELECT filename
        FROM (
            SELECT value || '/' || name as filename
            FROM v$diag_info
            WHERE name LIKE '%trc'
        );
    
    v_cmd VARCHAR2(1000);
BEGIN
    FOR rec IN c_trace_files LOOP
        v_cmd := 'start trcanlzr.sql ' || rec.filename;
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Processing: ' || rec.filename);
        
        -- Execute TRCA for each trace file
        EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'ALTER SESSION SET current_schema = TRCANLZR';
        -- Add actual TRCA execution logic here
        
    END LOOP;
END;
/
```

**Automated TRCA Report Generation:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Script: auto_trca_analysis.sh

# Configuration
ORACLE_SID=ORCL
TRACE_DIR=/u01/app/oracle/diag/rdbms/orcl/ORCL/trace
REPORT_DIR=/u01/reports/trca
DATE_SUFFIX=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)

# Find recent trace files
find $TRACE_DIR -name "*.trc" -mtime -1 > /tmp/trace_files_$DATE_SUFFIX.txt

# Process each trace file
while read trace_file; do
    if [ -f "$trace_file" ]; then
        echo "Processing $trace_file"
        
        # Connect to database and run TRCA
        sqlplus -S apps/password@$ORACLE_SID << EOF
        start /path/to/trca/run/trcanlzr.sql $trace_file
        exit;
EOF
        
        # Move generated reports
        mv *.html $REPORT_DIR/
        mv *.txt $REPORT_DIR/
    fi
done < /tmp/trace_files_$DATE_SUFFIX.txt

# Cleanup
rm /tmp/trace_files_$DATE_SUFFIX.txt
```

-- Find AWR snapshots corresponding to trace period
WITH trace_period AS (
    SELECT 
        MIN(timestamp) as trace_start,
        MAX(timestamp) as trace_end
    FROM trca$_trace_entries
    WHERE trace_filename = 'your_trace_file.trc'

  AND s.end_interval_time >= tp.trace_start

UNION ALL

SELECT 
    s.snap_id,
    s.begin_interval_time,
    s.end_interval_time,
    'AFTER_TRACE' as period_type
FROM dba_hist_snapshot s, trace_period tp
WHERE s.begin_interval_time >= tp.trace_end
  AND s.end_interval_time <= tp.trace_end + INTERVAL '2' HOUR

ORDER BY begin_interval_time;
```

#### TRCA + SQL Monitor Integration

**Enhanced Monitoring Setup:**
```sql
-- Enable SQL monitoring for traced sessions
ALTER SESSION SET "_sqlmon_threshold" = 0;  -- Monitor all SQL
ALTER SESSION SET control_management_pack_access = 'DIAGNOSTIC+TUNING';

-- Create monitoring report for traced SQL
SELECT 
    DBMS_SQLTUNE.REPORT_SQL_MONITOR(
        sql_id => 'your_sql_id',
        session_id => your_session_id,
        type => 'HTML',
        report_level => 'ALL'
    ) as sql_monitor_report
FROM dual;
```

### Troubleshooting TRCA Issues

#### Common Installation Problems

**Tablespace Issues:**
```sql
-- Diagnose tablespace problems
SELECT 
    'TRCANLZR user tablespace usage' as check_type,
    tablespace_name,
    ROUND(bytes/1024/1024, 2) as used_mb,
    blocks,
    segments
FROM (
    SELECT 
        s.tablespace_name,
        SUM(s.bytes) as bytes,
        SUM(s.blocks) as blocks,
        COUNT(*) as segments
    FROM dba_segments s
    WHERE s.owner = 'TRCANLZR'
    GROUP BY s.tablespace_name
);

-- Check for quota issues
SELECT username, tablespace_name, bytes, max_bytes
FROM dba_ts_quotas
WHERE username = 'TRCANLZR';
```

**Permission Issues:**
```sql
-- Verify required privileges
SELECT 
    'Missing Privileges' as issue_type,
    required_priv
FROM (
    SELECT 'SELECT ANY DICTIONARY' as required_priv FROM dual
    UNION ALL SELECT 'CREATE SESSION' FROM dual
    UNION ALL SELECT 'CREATE TABLE' FROM dual
    UNION ALL SELECT 'CREATE SEQUENCE' FROM dual
    UNION ALL SELECT 'CREATE PROCEDURE' FROM dual
) required
WHERE required_priv NOT IN (
    SELECT privilege 
    FROM dba_sys_privs 
    WHERE grantee = 'TRCANLZR'
    UNION
    SELECT privilege 
    FROM dba_sys_privs 
    WHERE grantee IN (
        SELECT granted_role 
        FROM dba_role_privs 
        WHERE grantee = 'TRCANLZR'
    )
);
```

#### Runtime Analysis Problems

**Trace File Access Issues:**
```bash
# Check trace file permissions and ownership
ls -la $ORACLE_BASE/diag/rdbms/*/trace/*.trc

# Verify Oracle user can read trace files
sudo -u oracle cat /path/to/trace/file.trc | head -10

# Check for trace file corruption
grep -c "PARSING IN CURSOR" /path/to/trace/file.trc
grep -c "EXEC" /path/to/trace/file.trc
grep -c "FETCH" /path/to/trace/file.trc
```

**Performance Optimization for TRCA:**
```sql
-- Optimize TRCA performance
ALTER SESSION SET optimizer_mode = ALL_ROWS;
ALTER SESSION SET sort_area_size = 134217728;  -- 128MB
ALTER SESSION SET hash_area_size = 134217728;  -- 128MB
ALTER SESSION SET parallel_degree_policy = ADAPTIVE;

-- Monitor TRCA execution
SELECT 
    s.sid,
    s.serial#,
    s.username,
    s.program,
    s.sql_id,
    s.sql_exec_start,
    s.last_call_et,
    s.status
FROM v$session s
WHERE s.username = 'TRCANLZR'
   OR s.program LIKE '%trcanlzr%';
```

# Oracle Database Performance Tuning Notes for Beginners

## Chapter 8: Understanding Histograms

###  What You'll Learn in This Chapter
- What histograms are and why they matter
- How histograms help Oracle make better decisions
- When to use histograms and when to avoid them
- Practical examples you can follow

---

###  What is a Histogram? 

Think of a histogram like a **bar chart that shows how your data is spread out**.

**Real-world analogy:** Imagine you're a store manager tracking sales by country:
- You sold 1000 items total
- 800 went to USA, 150 to Canada, 50 to Mexico

A histogram would show this as three bars with different heights, making it easy to see that USA gets most of your sales.

**In database terms:** A histogram tells Oracle how your data is distributed across different values in a column.

---

###  Why Do We Need Histograms?

**The Problem:** Oracle is like a GPS system for your data queries. Without good information, it might choose a slow route.

**Example Scenario:**
```
Table: CUSTOMER_ORDERS
Total rows: 10,000
Column: COUNTRY
Data distribution:
- USA: 9,000 customers
- Canada: 500 customers  
- Mexico: 500 customers
```

**Without Histogram (Oracle's Assumption):**
- Oracle thinks: "3 countries, so probably 3,333 customers each"
- For query: `SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER_ORDERS WHERE COUNTRY = 'Mexico'`
- Oracle expects 3,333 rows, so it chooses a slow method

**With Histogram (Reality):**
- Oracle knows: "Mexico only has 500 customers"
- Oracle chooses a faster method for finding just 500 rows

---

### 📈 Types of Histograms (Simplified)

#### 1. **Frequency Histograms** (Most Common)
- **What it is:** Each unique value gets its own bucket
- **When Oracle uses it:** When you have few unique values
- **Think of it as:** Individual boxes for each country

**Example:**
```
Bucket 1: USA (9,000 customers)
Bucket 2: Canada (500 customers)
Bucket 3: Mexico (500 customers)
```

#### 2. **Height-Balanced Histograms**
- **What it is:** Values are grouped into equal-sized buckets
- **When Oracle uses it:** When you have many unique values
- **Think of it as:** Grouping similar values together

**Example:**
```
Bucket 1: Countries with 0-3,333 customers
Bucket 2: Countries with 3,334-6,666 customers
Bucket 3: Countries with 6,667-10,000 customers
```

---

### 🔍 How to Check if Your Table Uses Histograms

**Simple Query:**
```sql
-- Replace 'YOUR_TABLE' and 'YOUR_COLUMN' with actual names
SELECT 
    column_name,
    num_buckets,
    histogram
FROM USER_TAB_COL_STATISTICS 
WHERE table_name = 'YOUR_TABLE' 
AND column_name = 'YOUR_COLUMN';
```

**What to look for:**
- `num_buckets > 1` = Histogram exists
- `histogram = 'FREQUENCY'` or `'HEIGHT BALANCED'` = Type of histogram

---

### ⚙️ Key Settings for Beginners

#### The METHOD_OPT Parameter (Don't worry, it's simpler than it sounds!)

**What it does:** Tells Oracle when to create histograms automatically

**Default setting (recommended for beginners):**
```sql
-- Check current setting
SELECT dbms_stats.get_prefs('METHOD_OPT') FROM dual;
```

**Typical result:** `FOR ALL COLUMNS SIZE AUTO`
- This means: "Oracle, please create histograms automatically when you think they're needed"

**If you want to change it:**
```sql
-- Let Oracle decide automatically (RECOMMENDED)
EXEC dbms_stats.set_global_prefs('METHOD_OPT','FOR ALL COLUMNS SIZE AUTO');

-- Turn off histograms completely (NOT recommended)
EXEC dbms_stats.set_global_prefs('METHOD_OPT','FOR ALL COLUMNS SIZE 1');
```

---

### 🛠️ Managing Histograms (Beginner Examples)

#### Removing a Histogram (if it's causing problems)
```sql
BEGIN 
    dbms_stats.delete_column_stats(
        ownname => 'YOUR_SCHEMA',  -- Replace with your schema name
        tabname => 'YOUR_TABLE',   -- Replace with your table name
        colname => 'YOUR_COLUMN',  -- Replace with your column name
        col_stat_type => 'HISTOGRAM'
    ); 
END; 
/
```

#### Preventing Future Histograms on Specific Columns
```sql
BEGIN 
    dbms_stats.set_table_prefs(
        'YOUR_SCHEMA',  -- Your schema
        'YOUR_TABLE',   -- Your table
        'METHOD_OPT' => 'FOR ALL COLUMNS SIZE AUTO, FOR COLUMNS SIZE 1 YOUR_COLUMN'
    ); 
END; 
/
```

### ✅ When Should You Use Histograms? (Beginner Guidelines)

#### **👍 CREATE histograms when:**

1. **Uneven data distribution**
   - Example: 90% of orders from one country, 10% from others
   - Example: Most employees earn $30K-$50K, but a few earn $200K+

2. **Column used in WHERE clauses**
   - Example: `WHERE country = 'USA'`
   - Example: `WHERE salary > 100000`

3. **Queries are running slowly**
   - Oracle might be making wrong assumptions about your data

#### **👎 DON'T CREATE histograms when:**

1. **Even data distribution**
   - Example: Sales are roughly equal across all months

2. **Primary key columns**
   - Example: Customer ID, Order ID (these are unique anyway)

3. **Columns not used in WHERE clauses**
   - No point in creating histograms for columns you don't filter on

---

### 🎯 Practical Tips for Beginners

#### **Start Simple:**
1. Let Oracle handle histograms automatically (use `SIZE AUTO`)
2. Only intervene if you notice performance problems
3. Focus on columns that appear in your WHERE clauses

#### **Monitoring:**
```sql
-- Check which columns have histograms
SELECT 
    table_name,
    column_name,
    num_buckets,
    histogram
FROM USER_TAB_COL_STATISTICS 
WHERE histogram != 'NONE'
ORDER BY table_name, column_name;
```

#### **Common Beginner Mistakes to Avoid:**
- ❌ Creating histograms on every column
- ❌ Creating histograms on primary keys
- ❌ Ignoring histogram maintenance
- ✅ Let Oracle decide automatically
- ✅ Monitor query performance
- ✅ Only create histograms when needed

---

### 📚 Key Takeaways

1. **Histograms help Oracle make smarter decisions** about how to execute your queries
2. **Frequency histograms are more common** and easier to understand
3. **Let Oracle manage histograms automatically** unless you have specific performance issues
4. **Focus on columns used in WHERE clauses** with uneven data distribution
5. **Monitor your query performance** to see if histograms are helping

---

### 🔧 Quick Reference Commands

```sql
-- Check histogram settings
SELECT dbms_stats.get_prefs('METHOD_OPT') FROM dual;

-- View histograms on your tables
SELECT table_name, column_name, histogram, num_buckets 
FROM USER_TAB_COL_STATISTICS 
WHERE histogram != 'NONE';

-- Update table statistics (this may create histograms)
EXEC dbms_stats.gather_table_stats('YOUR_SCHEMA', 'YOUR_TABLE');
```

---

*Remember: As a beginner, it's better to let Oracle manage histograms automatically rather than trying to micromanage them. Focus on understanding your data and query patterns first!*
